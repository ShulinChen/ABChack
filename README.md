Developed and Won @ ABC Hackathon, a UC Berkeley CS61 ABC sponsored event.

The actual TITLE of our project is: 
    Music Timer

Purpose:
    It is almost like a timer, except instead of counting down, we use various
    tools to select a song from SoundCloud that lasts approximately as long as
    your set time. For example, as soon as the music stops, you'll know that 
    the cookies you were baking are done!

Currently permitted Inputs:
    HOW LONG U WANT COOK (as a FLOAT in MINUTES)
    WHAT YOU WANT LISTEN TO (as a STRING of keywords)
    WHAT KIND MUSIC YOU LIKE (as a STRING of genre)
